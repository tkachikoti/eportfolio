									<p>Broken Access Control is a major concern in web application security, as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification or deletion of critical data, or unauthorized actions (Sharma et al, 2021). The primary cause of Broken Access Control is poor implementation of access controls and authorization rules by developers, who may fail to properly validate user input, implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, or rely on client-side controls instead of server-side controls (Sharma et al, 2021).</p>

									<p>The Capital One data breach of 2019 is a classic example of the consequences of Broken Access Control (Madnick et al, 2020). The attacker was able to exploit a misconfigured firewall in the cloud infrastructure to gain access to customer data, which included names, addresses, and credit scores, among others (Madnick et al, 2020). The lack of proper access controls and authentication mechanisms made it possible for the attacker to access this sensitive information (Madnick et al, 2020).</p>

									<p>To mitigate the negative consequences of Broken Access Control, it is crucial to implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, both on the client and server sides (Yamani et al, 2022). Developers should also ensure that they validate all user input and implement proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access (Yamani et al, 2022). Additionally, companies should conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address any vulnerabilities in their systems (Yamani et al, 2022).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, Broken Access Control is a serious security vulnerability that can lead to significant harm to organizations and their customers (Yamani et al, 2022). By implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms and conducting regular security assessments, companies can reduce the risk of Broken Access Control and protect their systems and data from potential attacks (Yamani et al, 2022).</p>
