									<p><strong>Preface:</strong> I read the Cryptography with Python blog at tutorialspoint.com (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/cryptography_with_python_quick_guide.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/cryptography_with_python_quick_guide.htm</a>). After reading the blog post, I used ROT13 Algorithm to create a python program that can take a short piece of text and encrypt it.</p>

									<p><strong>1. </strong> Why did I select the algorithm you chose?</p>

									<p>I selected the ROT13 Algorithm because it was simple to understand and implement. The algorithm is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter of the input text with the letter 13 places down the alphabet. This means that "A" is replaced with "N" and "B" is replaced with "O", and so on.</p>

									<p><strong>2. </strong> Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.</p>

									<p>ROT13 is not considered a secure encryption method and would not meet the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations (Sanchez et al, 2016). The GDPR requires that personal data be protected with appropriate security measures, including encryption (Mansfield-Devine, 2017). ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher that can be easily broken by anyone with a basic understanding of cryptography (Sanchez et al, 2016). In addition, the algorithm does not provide confidentiality or data integrity, which are key requirements of the GDPR (Mansfield-Devine, 2017).</p>

									<p>Therefore, the use of ROT13 would not be suitable for protecting personal data in accordance with the GDPR (Mansfield-Devine, 2017). Organizations that handle personal data must use encryption methods that provide confidentiality and data integrity, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or the RSA algorithm (Sanchez et al, 2016). The choice of encryption method will depend on the specific requirements of the organization and the sensitivity of the data being protected (Mansfield-Devine, 2017).</p>
