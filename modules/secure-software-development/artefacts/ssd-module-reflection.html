									<hr class="major" />

									<p>Throughout the 12-week team project for my Secure Software Development module at the University of Essex, I had the opportunity to work on a proof of concept for a software application called First4Aid. The main objective of the project was to create secure communication channels between humanitarian aid providers and those in need during large-scale emergencies. The project was a valuable learning experience, and I am proud of what my team was able to achieve.</p>

									<p>The project allowed me to apply the theoretical concepts I had learned in my computer science course, including event-driven architecture, zero-trust architecture, object-oriented programming design principles, and Python programming language skills. I was particularly challenged by the development of a low-bandwidth user interface using Flask and the integration of message queueing and event monitoring using RabbitMQ. The use of the asyncio Python module for concurrency across multiple threads was also a new concept for me, but it was an excellent opportunity to expand my knowledge of this technology.</p>

									<p>Working in a team of five students was a challenge in terms of communication and time management, but it was a valuable opportunity for me to develop my teamwork and communication skills. Regular team meetings and open discussions about the project's progress helped to foster a positive and productive working environment. I also learned the importance of time management, as we had to ensure that we met weekly project milestones and completed the project within the 12-week timeframe.</p>

									<p>The project also provided me with a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by humanitarian aid providers and aid requestors in disaster situations. I came to appreciate the crucial role that secure and reliable communication channels play in these scenarios. Our team incorporated various design elements that emphasized security, scalability, and accessibility for users, such as using Amazon Web Services' Elastic Compute Cloud and a zero-trust architecture for user authentication and authorization (Ford & Richards, 2020).</p>

									<p>The project allowed us to demonstrate the application of our module learning outcomes in practice. Our team was able to identify and manage security risks by implementing a zero-trust architecture and encrypting data in transit and at rest. This shows that we considered the security of the system and its users as a priority throughout the development process. Additionally, our expertise in object-oriented programming was evident in our use of these principles while building the web application using Python, demonstrating our capability to design and create computer programs that fulfil the project's specifications (Gregory & Percival, 2020).</p>

									<p>Our team also demonstrated their capacity to tackle development issues by evaluating various methodologies, tools, and techniques to come up with the best solutions. For example, we utilized the asyncio Python module to facilitate multi-threaded concurrency, which ensured the system's ability to process data streams from numerous aid requestors simultaneously (Gregory & Percival, 2020). Additionally, our proficiency in working together effectively in a virtual development setting was showcased throughout the project. We honed the necessary skills to be an integral part of a development team in a virtual work environment, incorporating practical viewpoints on team responsibilities and structure (Deshpande et al, 2016).</p>

									<p>At the start of the project, our team was professional and established rapport with each other quickly. We leveraged each other's strengths and identified areas for improvement, which helped drive the project forward. During the requirements gathering phase, the teammate with experience in project management was instrumental in directing the team. The teammate with experience as a software engineer provided insight into the technical feasibility of our ideas. The teammate with experience working with GDPR helped navigate the security and privacy policy considerations of our software solution, while the teammate with experience working with government organizations provided valuable insights into the software solution we were developing.</p>

									<p>One of the challenges we faced was a teammate who did not complete any assigned tasks. After a one-to-one meeting, they explained that they were struggling to balance their university work and other commitments. I reassured them that the team was ready and willing to support. However, this intervention did yield a positive outcome as the team member disengaged with the project completely.</p>

									<p>The project provided a platform for me to develop and showcase my technical skills in software development, particularly in the areas of event-driven architecture, zero-trust architecture, object-oriented programming, and Python programming. The integration of message queueing and event monitoring using RabbitMQ and the use of asyncio Python module for concurrency across multiple threads allowed me to expand my knowledge in these areas.</p>

									<p>Furthermore, the project was a great opportunity for me to work in a team and develop my communication and collaboration skills. Regular team meetings and open discussions were key in ensuring we met weekly project milestones and were able to complete the project within the 12-week timeframe. Through this experience, I learned the importance of time management, effective communication, and collaboration in ensuring the success of a project.</p>

									<p>The project also provided me with a better understanding of the challenges faced by humanitarian aid providers and aid requestors in disaster situations. The importance of secure and reliable communication channels in such scenarios cannot be overstated, and our team was able to demonstrate the application of this concept in the First4Aid application.</p>

									<p>Overall, my experience in this project has been invaluable and has provided me with a deeper understanding of the software development process. I am proud of what my team was able to accomplish and grateful for the opportunities to learn and develop my skills. The lessons I have learned from this project, such as effective communication, collaboration, and leveraging the strengths of each team member, will be useful for me in future projects and endeavours.</p>
