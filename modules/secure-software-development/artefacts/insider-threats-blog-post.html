										<h1>Blog Post: Mitigating Insider Threats</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>Insider threats pose a significant risk to organisations and can result in the loss of sensitive information, damage to reputation, and financial losses (Pereira & Santos, 2015). It is crucial for organisations to take proactive steps to mitigate these threats and minimize the risk of a breach (Pereira & Santos, 2015). In this blog post, I will outline how organisations can mitigate the five insider threats.</p>

									<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> - To ensure confidentiality, organisations must have strict access controls and user authentication mechanisms in place (Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021). This includes limiting the amount of sensitive information an employee can access and restricting access to critical systems. Additionally, organisations can implement encryption and data loss prevention (DLP) technologies to protect sensitive information.</p>

									<p><strong>Access Control</strong> - Implementing a robust access control system is essential to prevent insider threats. This includes implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and ensuring that all access to sensitive information and systems is properly monitored and logged (Patino et al, 2018). Organisations can also implement multi-factor authentication to enhance the security of their access control systems (Patino et al, 2018).</p>
									
									<p><strong>User Awareness and Training</strong> - Regular training and awareness programs for employees can help to reduce the risk of insider threats (Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021). This includes educating employees on the importance of cyber security and how to identify and prevent cyber attacks (Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021). Additionally, organisations can conduct regular phishing simulations to test the effectiveness of their awareness and training programs (Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021).</p>

									<p><strong>Incident Management</strong> - Having an effective incident management plan in place is critical to responding to and mitigating the impact of an insider threat (Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021). This includes having a well-defined incident response plan, regularly testing and updating the plan, and training all employees on how to respond in the event of a breach (Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021).</p>
									
									<p><strong>Management</strong> - Conducting regular risk assessments is critical to identifying and mitigating the risk of insider threats. This includes identifying potential threats, assessing the likelihood and impact of these threats, and implementing controls to minimize the risk (Patino et al, 2018). Organisations can also implement a continuous monitoring program to identify potential threats and respond quickly in the event of a breach (Patino et al, 2018).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, mitigating insider threats requires a combination of technical controls, user awareness and training, incident management, and risk management (Patino et al, 2018; Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021). By implementing these measures, organisations can minimize the risk of a breach and ensure the confidentiality and security of their sensitive information (Patino et al, 2018; Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021). Regularly reviewing and updating these measures is essential to staying ahead of evolving threats and maintaining the security of the organisation (Patino et al, 2018; Fonseca-Herrera et al, 2021).</p>
