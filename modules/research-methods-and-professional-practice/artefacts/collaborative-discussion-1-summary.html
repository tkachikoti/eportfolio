										<h1>Collaborative Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct - Summary</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>In my initial post on the case study involving Stewart, I discussed how several key sections of the code were violated (British Computer Society, 2022). Specifically, the issues around accessibility for visually impaired users and deceptive design patterns (British Computer Society, 2022). My discussion post highlighted a lack of adherence to ethical standards in professional conduct. The use of red and green text combined with the misleading addition of a warranty without consent demonstrates breaches of both inclusivity principles and transparency (British Computer Society, 2022; Brenncke, 2024).</p>

									<p>Upon further reflection, it becomes clear that these violations reflect broader societal and professional issues. The case demonstrates how dark UX patterns not only harm individuals but also erode trust in digital services and the technology profession (Maier, 2019). Ethical lapses can have significant ripple effects, from reputational damage to potential legal consequences (Maier, 2019; Brenncke, 2024). The BCS Code of Conduct serves as a vital framework for ensuring that technology professionals safeguard user interests (British Computer Society, 2022). The case also emphasises the need for continuous education on ethical design practices (Gogoll et al., 2021).</p>

									<p>Looking forward, this case reinforces the importance of embedding ethical considerations throughout the development process (Gogoll et al., 2021). Beyond compliance with established codes of conduct, technology professionals must proactively consider the broader social implications of their work (Gogoll et al., 2021). This reflective process not only ensures adherence to professional standards but, it also contributes to building technology that serves and protects society responsibly (Maier, 2019).</p>
