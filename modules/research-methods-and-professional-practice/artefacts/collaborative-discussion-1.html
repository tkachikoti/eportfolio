									<p>The British Computer Society (2022) Code of Conduct has several relevant tenets that Stewart should have considered. According to section 1a under Public Interest, Stewart is obliged to respect public health, privacy, security, and the well-being of others (British Computer Society, 2022). There is also an obligation to avoid discriminating based on disabilities as outlined in section 1b (British Computer Society, 2022). The red and green text colour combination negatively impacted visually impaired users, which is a failure to promote inclusivity and equal access to information (Brenncke, 2024).</p>

									<p>Stewart expressed concerns about the deceptive design elements which misled users into making unwanted purchases. According to section 3e under Duty to Relevant Authority, computing professionals should not misrepresent or withhold information on the performance of products or services (British Computer Society, 2022). The silent addition of a warranty without user consent violates this principle. Furthermore, according to section 4d under Duty to the Profession, Stewart should protect the profession's integrity and avoid practices that could harm its reputation (British Computer Society, 2022).</p>

									<p>Socially, this case reflects unethical business practices that exploit users, impacting trust in technology (Maier, 2019). The client may be exposed to complaints or litigation for misleading advertising and violating accessibility laws (Brenncke, 2024). Overall, Stewart and his team’s involvement in dark UX patterns erodes professionalism and public trust.</p>
