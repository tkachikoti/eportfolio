									<p><strong>Response:</strong> Hey  Njideka,</p>

									<p>Thank you for your insightful discussion on the "Malicious Inputs to Content Filters" case study. I appreciate how you've tied the BCS Code of Conduct to the developer’s responsibilities in this situation. You rightly point out the ethical conflict between meeting the CIPA requirements and ensuring non-discriminatory practices.</p>

									<p>The violation of the BCS Code regarding discrimination is critical. Especially when topics like sexual orientation and climate change were unjustly blocked. It’s important to note that while protecting minors is a priority, the lack of transparency regarding the limitations of the algorithm also undermines trust with users.</p>

									<p>Additionally, I agree with your assessment of Blocker Plus’ failure in maintaining system security. Allowing activist groups to manipulate the filtering system directly violates the duty to protect the integrity of the software and its users. This could have been avoided by designing a more robust feedback mechanism.</p>

									<p>Overall, your analysis highlights the importance of continuous ethical oversight in AI development, ensuring it serves the public interest without unintended consequences.</p>

									<p><strong>Response:</strong> Hey Fatma,</p>

									<p>Your analysis of the "Automated Active Response Weaponry" case is thorough. The shift to aggressive autonomous systems with lethal capabilities raises significant moral and legal issues. The violations under the ACM Code of Ethics around public safety and protecting individuals from harm are paramount. The BCS Code of Conduct also aligns here, emphasising "Public Interest" and the responsibility to avoid causing harm. Especially with technologies that could infringe on human rights.</p>

									<p>I agree with your concerns regarding privacy and data protection, as the use of facial recognition and personal data without explicit consent could easily breach regulations like GDPR. These technologies not only risk misuse but could also unjustly target individuals. Further exacerbating concerns around algorithmic bias and transparency in decision-making.</p>

									<p>Your point on whistleblower protections is important. Suppressing engineers who raise ethical concerns undermines professional integrity. Plus, it highlights the need for stronger protections in cases where ethical violations are apparent. By threatening legal action, Q Industries further damages its credibility and reputation. Further showcasing a disregard for ethical accountability.</p>

									<p>Overall, this case exemplifies the importance of strict adherence to ethical standards in high-stakes industries like defence. Industries where public safety and human rights must be prioritised.</p>

									<p><strong>Response:</strong> Hey Dominika,</p>

									<p>Thanks for sharing your discussion of the Corazon case study, it made for an interesting read. It raises important ethical considerations around the handling of vulnerabilities in medical technology. Corazon’s commitment to patient data security and its open bug bounty program demonstrate a strong alignment with ethical principles such as those outlined in ACM’s Code of Ethics. However, your observation about the company's decision not to address a seemingly minor vulnerability invites deeper scrutiny.</p>

									<p>As highlighted in both the ACM and BCS Codes of Conduct, organisations should prioritise public safety and security. Which includes addressing even low-risk vulnerabilities. The BCS Principle 1a, which mandates consideration for public health, privacy, and security, applies here. By disregarding the potential risk, Corazon may be neglecting its duty to fully safeguard patients. Especially considering the unpredictability of future developments or misuse.</p>

									<p>I agree with your point that determining the severity of a vulnerability should involve independent oversight. This approach ensures that risks are evaluated with impartiality, preventing companies from downplaying concerns for convenience. Additionally, collaboration between researchers and companies is essential in assessing risks holistically. Ensuring both safety and scalability in technologies. In medical devices, the stakes are too high to ignore any security risks.</p>
