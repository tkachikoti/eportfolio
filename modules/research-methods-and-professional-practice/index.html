									<h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing</h2>

									<p>I gained a deeper understanding of the scientific method and its application to research within the field of computer science. The exploration of inductive versus deductive reasoning clarified how to structure investigations systematically. There was a focus on the ethical dimensions of research in the context of emerging technologies such as generative AI. Reflective Activity 1 on ethics in computing highlighted the global discourse on the governance of AI and the ethical frameworks needed to manage its rapid advancements. I realised the importance of awareness of the social, legal, and professional responsibilities linked to AI developments. Particularly, when navigating the ethical grey areas in AI usage. This unit has broadened my perspective on ethical decision-making, which is crucial for my research and professional practice.</p>

									<h2>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h2>
									
									<p>In Unit 2, I learned the importance of refining a research idea into a well-structured research question. Which forms the foundation of any successful research proposal. Initially, defining a research topic felt daunting. But, understanding the characteristics of a strong research question helped me break the process down into manageable steps. The introduction to conducting literature reviews was particularly enlightening. As I recognised the value of reviewing existing scholarly work to identify gaps and build a rationale for my own research. This process deepened my understanding of how to critically evaluate literature and present findings cohesively. Overall, this unit equipped me with the tools to formulate research questions creatively and rationally. Plus, I gained an understanding of how to conduct a thorough literature review.</p>

									<h2>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods</h2>

									<p>In Unit 3, I developed a comprehensive understanding of research methodologies and their underlying assumptions. The exploration of ontological, epistemological, and axiological assumptions helped me recognise how my perspectives shape my research design and methods. This insight reinforced the importance of choosing methodologies that align with the nature of my research question. Learning about exploratory and conclusive research designs provided a solid framework for distinguishing between different approaches based on research goals. I also gained valuable knowledge on qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research. Which allowed me to critically assess which data collection techniques would best suit my research. This unit emphasised the importance of aligning methodology with research objectives and prepared me to make informed decisions about my research methods.</p>

									<h2>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h2>

									<p>In Unit 4, I gained valuable insights into different qualitative data collection methods, including case studies, focus groups, and observations. I learned that case studies provide context-rich insights but, can introduce bias and may not be ideal for establishing generalisable findings. Focus groups, on the other hand, emphasise shared experiences and allow for dynamic discussion but, require careful selection of participants to ensure relevant data. Observational methods offered an interesting perspective on monitoring behaviour, both quantitatively and qualitatively. I found the distinction between qualitative and quantitative observation particularly helpful in determining when to apply each method depending on the nature of the data required. This unit equipped me with the skills to critically assess the suitability of these methods for my research and the type of data they can produce.</p>


									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h2>

									<p>Unit 5 provided me with an in-depth understanding of the various methods used to gather data. The distinction between surveys and questionnaires was particularly valuable. I now appreciate that a questionnaire is just the tool used for collecting responses. A survey encompasses the entire process of collecting, analysing, and interpreting data. I also learned about the importance of designing effective questionnaires. Whether it's for qualitative or quantitative research and, the potential pitfalls that can arise in technical areas. Pre-testing and post-testing emerged as insightful tools to evaluate changes before and after implementing a system or process. This unit has strengthened my ability to design well-structured questionnaires. Plus, my ability to analyse the responses to ensure that I gather the data required for my research effectively.</p>


									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Unit 6: Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h2>

									<p>I gained an understanding of how quantitative methods are used to analyse relationships between variables through statistical techniques. The introduction to descriptive statistics was particularly insightful. It allowed me to see how data can be summarised meaningfully using measures of location. I now recognise the importance of identifying the appropriate level of measurement for variables in order to select the correct statistical method. This unit also emphasised the significance of organising data into datasets for analysis. Overall, I am more confident in my ability to apply descriptive statistics to analyse data effectively and summarise key insights.</p>


									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Unit 7: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing</h2>

									<p>Unit 7 provided me with a deeper understanding of inferential statistics and, its role in making predictions about a larger population based on sample data. I learned how inferential statistics allows us to generalise findings beyond the sample, quantifying uncertainty through probability. The introduction to hypothesis testing was particularly valuable. It highlighted how this method is used to compare population values and, determine if assumptions about the data hold. This process of testing assumptions rather than just estimating values opened my eyes to the practical applications of inferential statistics. Overall, this unit strengthened my ability to apply statistical inference, identify probability distributions, and conduct hypothesis tests. All of which are essential tools for analysing and interpreting data.</p>

									<h2>Unit 8: Data Analysis and Visualisation</h2>

									<p>In Unit 8, I explored how to effectively handle and analyse both qualitative and quantitative data. I learned that while descriptive statistics can summarise quantitative data clearly, qualitative data requires careful coding and interpretation due to its open-ended nature. The need to remain unbiased during the analysis of qualitative data was emphasised, as qualitative insights can vary based on interpretation. I also gained an understanding of how data visualisation through dashboards. The use of charts, graphs, and dashboards in business intelligence was a key takeaway. They allow for the clear presentation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. This unit helped me appreciate the balance between rigorous data analysis and the importance of clear, visual communication of findings.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Unit 9: Validity and Generalisability in Research</h2>
									
									<p>I gained a clearer understanding of the key concepts of validity, reliability, and generalisability in research. I learned that they need to be considered before data collection to ensure the integrity of the research process. Additionally, I realised the importance of data cleansing and validation. Especially when working with quantitative data that leads to descriptive and inferential statistics. This unit emphasised how these concepts impact the design of research methods and the analysis of data, ultimately shaping the conclusions drawn from the investigation.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Unit 10: Research Writing</h2>

									<p>Unit 10 focused on research writing, which I found particularly beneficial as it ties together many aspects of the research process. The unit provided clear guidance on structuring a dissertation. This helped me to understand the different sections such as the introduction, literature review, methodology and results. I gained insight into how to approach each part of the dissertation which will be invaluable for my final project. This unit emphasised that strong research writing is essential for communicating complex ideas and technical knowledge effectively.</p>
