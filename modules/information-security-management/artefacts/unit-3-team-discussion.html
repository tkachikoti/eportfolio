									<p><strong>1. What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</strong></p>

									<p>There are several factors that determine whether a programming language is secure or not. Firstly, the language itself, some programming languages have been built with modern issues in mind, while others may have vulnerabilities inherent in their design (Gasiba et al, 2020). For instance, C is prone to error-handling issues, while Python has built-in error handlers that can stop the program in the event of faulty code (Gasiba et al, 2020). Similarly, PHP is prone to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) errors (Gasiba et al, 2020). This is due to its original design as a language for websites and the fact that its functionality has not kept pace with the evolving distributed nature of modules and code from open-source software libraries (Gasiba et al, 2020).</p>

									<p>Another important factor is the change in the environments and purposes for which languages are used (Ruef et al, 2016). As the uses change, new challenges arise that were not originally anticipated when the language was created (Ruef et al, 2016).</p>

									<p><strong>2. Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</strong></p>

									<p>Python could be considered a relatively secure language due to its built-in error handling for fatal errors and its track record to date (Holkner & Harland, 2009). However, it is not a perfect solution, and newer languages like Rust offer enhanced security features, such as enhanced error reporting and memory management (Ruef et al, 2016). Nevertheless, Python's built-in error-handling mechanisms make it a relatively secure choice for programming (Holkner & Harland, 2009).</p>

									<p><strong>3. Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</strong></p>

									<p>Research shows that Python is not suitable for creating operating systems as it is too slow for this purpose (Prechelt, 2000). A lower-level language like C is more effective in serving as an operating system language (Prechelt, 2000). However, designing an operating system in C requires extensive testing to ensure stability and security, which can be a significant drawback (Prechelt, 2000).</p>
