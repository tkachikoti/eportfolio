									<p>Cyclomatic complexity is a commonly used metric in evaluating the design of code (Ebert et al, 2016). It measures the number of independent paths within a module and is used to determine the testability and maintainability of the code (Ebert et al, 2016). However, the relevance of this metric in today's software development practices is a matter of debate (Ebert et al, 2016).</p>

									<p>On one hand, cyclomatic complexity remains relevant today because it helps developers identify complex areas in their code and prioritize them for testing (Gill, 2018). This reduces the likelihood of bugs and vulnerabilities in the code, making it more secure (Gill, 2018). Furthermore, the cyclomatic complexity can also serve as a guide for developers to refactor their code and make it more manageable, which can also improve the overall security of the software (Gill, 2018).</p>

									<p>On the other hand, some argue that cyclomatic complexity may not be as relevant today because of the increased use of testing frameworks, automated testing tools, and continuous integration practices (Westfall, 2016). These technologies help ensure that code is tested thoroughly, regardless of its cyclomatic complexity, making the metric less critical in assessing the quality and security of software (Westfall, 2016).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, whether cyclomatic complexity remains relevant today is dependent on the specific context and the practices used in software development (Gill, 2018). However, in the context of developing secure software, it can still be useful in highlighting complex areas of code and guiding the development process towards a more secure and maintainable design (Westfall, 2016).</p>
