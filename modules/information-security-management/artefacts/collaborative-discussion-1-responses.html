									<h2>Peer Response 1</h2>

									<p>Original post: <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=143905">https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=143905</a></p>
									
									<p><strong>Response:</strong> Great work on this post Etkin! Your reflections provide a good summary of the main points of the article by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). Your examples are well-chosen and provide a clear outline of the risks associated with Industry 4.0. Your reflections also include relevant citations to support the points made. With regard to the degree of similarity between the articles by Snieska et al. (2020) and Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019), the two articles approach the topic of digitalisation and its risks from different perspectives. Snieska et al. (2020) focus on technical information and innovation risks of Industry 4.0 in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Slovakia and Poland, while Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) discuss the risks of digitalization of business models in general.</p>

									<p>Snieska et al. (2020) emphasise the risks associated with the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as cybersecurity threats, compatibility issues, and costs, especially for SMEs. The authors highlight the importance of having adequate technical knowledge and expertise to manage these risks and avoid negative consequences. On the other hand, Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) emphasise the risks associated with digital transformation in general, such as increased competition, changes in consumer behaviour, and the need for new business models.</p>

									<p>While the two articles may seem to approach different aspects of digitalization, they are complementary in nature, as they both acknowledge the risks that come with the adoption of new technologies (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019; Snieska et al., 2020). Both articles emphasize the need for companies to understand the potential risks and develop strategies to manage them effectively (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019; Snieska et al., 2020). Snieska et al. (2020) highlight the importance of technical expertise, while Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) emphasise the need for businesses to be flexible and adaptable to change. In summary, these two articles support each other by emphasising the importance of understanding the risks of digitalisation and the need for appropriate risk management strategies (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019; Snieska et al., 2020).</p>

									<p><strong>Response:</strong> The negative consequences of insecure design in software development can range from data breaches and theft of sensitive information to system compromise and loss of credibility (Bach-Nutman, 2020). OWASP provides a comprehensive set of guidelines to prevent these consequences from occurring in the first place (Bach-Nutman, 2020).</p>

									<p>One way to mitigate the risks associated with insecure design is to adopt a secure design culture and methodology. This involves constantly evaluating threats and ensuring that code is robustly designed and tested to prevent known attack methods (Kamaruzaman et al, 2009). Additionally, using secure design patterns, such as those recommended by OWASP, can help to avoid the mishandling of sensitive information, unprotected or insufficiently protected credentials, and trust boundary violations (Kamaruzaman et al, 2009).</p>

									<p>Another effective way to mitigate the risks associated with insecure design is to use Agile and SCRUM methodologies (Bach-Nutman, 2020). These approaches can help to tackle insecure design from the outset of a project, by ensuring that any potential failure states are identified and documented during the design phase (Bach-Nutman, 2020).</p>

									<p>OWASP also recommends incorporating threat modelling into the software development process (Kamaruzaman et al, 2009). Threat modelling can help to identify potential security risks in the design and implementation of software applications and allow organizations to prioritize their remediation efforts (Bach-Nutman, 2020).</p>

									<p>Finally, it is important to continually monitor and update security practices, as well as stay informed about new threats and vulnerabilities. This can be done through regular training and education, as well as keeping up-to-date with the latest security news and best practices (Kamaruzaman et al, 2009).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, the negative consequences of insecure design in software development can be mitigated through the adoption of secure design culture and methodology, the use of Agile and SCRUM methodologies, threat modelling, and regular training and education (Kamaruzaman et al, 2009; Bach-Nutman, 2020). By following these recommendations, organizations can ensure that their software applications are robust, safe, and up-to-standard.</p>
