									<p>1. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) define Industry 4.0 as the fourth industrial revolution, which integrates advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and big data analytics into the manufacturing process. Two examples of Industry 4.0 technologies are:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Smart factories where machines are interconnected and can communicate with each other (Cerquitelli, 2021).</li>
										<li>Predictive maintenance systems use AI and machine learning algorithms to predict equipment failures and optimise maintenance schedules (Cerquitelli, 2021).</li>
									</ul>

									<p>2. Two examples of risks that fit into the authors' categories are:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Cyberattacks: These fall under the category of intentional risks and are aimed at compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems (Appiah et al, 2019). A real-world example is the WannaCry ransomware attack that affected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide in 2017 (Chen & Bridges, 2017).</li>
										<li>System failures: These fall under unintentional risks and can result from power outages, human error, and hardware or software faults (Munro, 2022). A real-world example is the 2019 outage of the cloud-based service provider Google Cloud, which disrupted services for several hours for customers worldwide (Munro, 2022).</li>
									</ul>

									<p>3. 'Digital risk: Transforming risk management for the 2020s' by Ganguly et al (2017) is an article that supports the points made in the cited case study. This article's framework aligns with the Kovaite and Stankeviciene (2019) study's emphasis on a holistic approach to managing digital risk. This includes identifying and assessing threats across the organization, developing risk management strategies that align with business objectives, and building a culture of risk awareness and accountability (Ganguly et al, 2017). In addition to this, both articles emphasise the importance of continuous improvement. This includes regular monitoring and evaluation of risk management strategies, and the ability to adjust those strategies in response to new and emerging risks (Ganguly et al, 2017).</p>
