									<p><strong>Response:</strong> The downfall of TrueCrypt came about as a result of the negative perception of the addon as well as the lack of developer support (Slapnicar et al, 2022). In order to prevent such incidents from happening in the future, several measures could be put in place (Josang et al, 2015). Firstly, transparency and accountability are important in the development of software, especially security-minded ones (Josang et al, 2015). Knowing who is behind a project can help build trust and increase accountability (Josang et al, 2015). Additionally, developers need to make sure that they are able to continue supporting the software and providing regular updates and patches to address vulnerabilities and bugs (Josang et al, 2015). This is particularly important for security-focused software as the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities is higher (Josang et al, 2015). Finally, regular security audits should be conducted to identify and address any potential weaknesses in the software (Josang et al, 2015).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, while Truecrypt was well-regarded in the early stages of its development, the abrupt departure of its developers and the subsequent warning that the software was insecure highlights the importance of having transparency, accountability, and ongoing support for software (Josang et al, 2015). These measures can help prevent similar incidents from happening in the future and ensure the security and reliability of the software (Josang et al, 2015).</p>
