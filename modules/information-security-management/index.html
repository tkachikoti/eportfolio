									<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h2>

									<p>One of the key ways in which this unit has helped me to develop is by improving my critical thinking and analytical skills. Through reading and discussing of risks around applying digitalisation to more traditional business processes, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of risk and the various ways in which it can be conceptualised. This helped me to develop a more nuanced approach to assessing and managing risks, taking into account multiple perspectives and factors.</p>

									<p>Also, by exploring different approaches to quantify and qualify risks, I was able to expand my toolkit for risk assessment and management, enabling me to select the most appropriate methods for a given situation. This required me to be able to analyse and compare different approaches, weighing their advantages and disadvantages in light of specific risk scenarios.</p>

									<p>Overall, these tasks have helped me to develop valuable skills and knowledge that will serve me well both personally and professionally. They have enabled me to approach risk management in a more nuanced and effective way. While also deepening my understanding of the broader context of information security management.</p>
