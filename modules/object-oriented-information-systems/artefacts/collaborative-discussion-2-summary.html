									<p>To mitigate the disadvantages of document-oriented databases, several measures can be put in place. One possible solution is to use a combination of both document-oriented and relational databases (Khine & Wang, 2019). This approach, known as polyglot persistence, allows for the use of the best tool for the specific task at hand, while still maintaining the ability to perform complex queries and transactions (Khine & Wang, 2019).</p>

									<p>For example, a social media platform could use a document-oriented database to store user profiles and posts, while using a relational database to store data related to analytics and reporting (Khine & Wang, 2019). This way, the platform can take advantage of the flexibility and scalability of the document store, while still being able to perform complex data analysis and reporting using the relational database (Khine & Wang, 2019).</p>

									<p>Another solution is to use a search engine, such as Elasticsearch or Solr, which can be integrated with a document-oriented database to provide advanced query functionality (Gallinucci et al, 2018). This approach allows for the use of the document store to store and manage data, while still providing the ability to perform complex queries and reporting using the search engine (Gallinucci et al, 2018).</p>

									<p>Additionally, to mitigate the lack of consistency and integrity, data validation and data normalization techniques can be implemented (Khine & Wang, 2019). These techniques can be used to ensure that data is consistent across different documents and that it meets specific requirements, such as data types and constraints (Khine & Wang, 2019).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, while document-oriented databases have their own unique advantages and disadvantages, these can be mitigated by implementing a combination of solutions. By using a combination of both document-oriented and relational databases, integrating a search engine, and implementing data validation and normalization techniques, it is possible to take advantage of the strengths of document stores while still addressing the limitations of this type of database (Khine & Wang, 2019).</p>
