									<h2>Peer Response 1</h2>

									<p>Original post: <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=299598">https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=299598</a></p>
									
									<p><strong>Response:</strong> The failure of the IT system upgrade at Walkers highlights the importance of proper planning and testing in the implementation of new information systems. One measure that could have been put in place to prevent this incident is a thorough risk assessment and testing plan (Stoneburner et al, 2002). This could have identified potential issues with the upgrade and allowed for more comprehensive testing of the system before it was rolled out (Stoneburner et al, 2002).</p>

									<p>Another measure that could have been put in place is a disaster recovery plan (Iyer et al, 1998). This would have allowed for more efficient response and recovery from the system failure and minimised production disruption (Iyer et al, 1998).</p>

									<p>Additionally, having a system in place for continuous monitoring and maintenance would have prevented the incident (Iyer et al, 1998).. This would have allowed for any issues with the system to be identified and addressed before they became critical (Iyer et al, 1998). It would also have provided a more proactive approach to identifying and addressing issues with the system, rather than a reactive one (Iyer et al, 1998).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, proper planning, testing, and disaster recovery planning are essential in the implementation of new information systems. These measures would have prevented the incident at Walkers and minimised production disruption, economic impact, and customer dissatisfaction. Continuous monitoring and maintenance are also important to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the system.</p>

									<p><strong>Response:</strong> The 2012 system failure at RBS highlights the importance of proper maintenance and support of information systems. One measure that could have been put in place to prevent this incident is a comprehensive maintenance and support plan (Jiang et al, 2011). This plan would have ensured that the system was regularly updated, maintained, and tested to prevent any failures from occurring (Jiang et al, 2011).</p>

									<p>Another measure that could have been put in place is to have a dedicated in-house team responsible for maintaining and supporting the system (Baldwin et al, 2001). This would have ensured that the team was familiar with the system and had the necessary expertise to identify and resolve any issues that may arise (Baldwin et al, 2001). Furthermore, having dedicated training programs for the in-house team would have provided them with the necessary skills to maintain and support the system (Baldwin et al, 2001).</p>

									<p>Additionally, having a system in place for continuous monitoring would have prevented the incident (Kemerer et al, 1991). This would have allowed for any issues with the system to be identified and addressed before they became critical, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the system (Kemerer et al, 1991).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, proper maintenance, support, and continuous monitoring are essential in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of information systems. These measures would have prevented the incident at RBS and minimised the impact on customers and the financial losses incurred by the company.</p>
