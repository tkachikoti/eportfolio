										<h1>System Implementation - Evaluation</h1>
									</header>

									<p>The completion of the System Implementation assignment has been an extremely valuable learning experience for me. Through the development of a CRUD web app with Flask for managing the schedule and prescriptions for patients at a General Practitioner, I have been able to deepen my understanding of the concepts and principles of information systems, as well as gain practical experience in designing and implementing an object-oriented information system.</p>

									<p>One of the positives of completing this project was that it allowed me to develop my skills in web development technologies such as Flask, Bootstrap, and Jinja. I also gained experience in working with SQLite 3 and DB-API 2.0, which helped me to understand how to work with databases in a Python environment. Additionally, the use of Docker for containerizing the web app helped me to understand how to deploy a web application in a production environment.</p>

									<p>One of the negatives of completing this project was the challenge of learning and implementing new technologies and concepts in a short amount of time. However, this also turned out to be an opportunity to develop my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, as well as my ability to learn quickly.</p>

									<p>Overall, this assignment has had a significant impact on my personal and professional development. I have gained a deeper understanding of information systems and web development, which will be useful in my future career. Additionally, the experience of designing, implementing, and testing a web application has provided me with the skills needed to develop and critically evaluate information system solutions to facilitate business decisions.</p>

									<p>In terms of the module learning outcomes, I believe that the work I completed for this assignment related well to the objective to "Develop an object-oriented information system design, implementing this knowledge using Python and SQL." I was able to apply my knowledge of object-oriented programming and database design to the project and implement it successfully. Additionally, the assignment also allowed me to "Develop, implement and critically evaluate information system solutions to facilitate business decisions." I was able to design and implement a solution that would be useful for managing patient schedules and prescriptions in a GP practice.</p>

									<p>Overall, completing this assignment has had a significant impact on my personal and professional development. I have gained valuable skills and experience in web development and database design that will be useful in future projects and job opportunities. I am confident that the knowledge and experience I gained from this assignment will be beneficial for my future career in the field of information systems.</p>
