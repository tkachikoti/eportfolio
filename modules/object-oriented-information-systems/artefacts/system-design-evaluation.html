										<h1>Mid-Module Assignment: System Design - Evaluation</h1>
									</header>

									<p>The System Design assignment was a valuable learning experience for me. By using UML to design a new software system to manage self-service checkouts at a supermarket, I was able to apply the concepts and principles of information systems that I had learned in class to a real-world scenario. This helped me to understand how these concepts and principles can be used in practice to design and develop information systems.</p>

									<p>One of the positives of completing this assignment was that I was able to improve my skills in using UML to design object-oriented information systems. I was able to use class diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams to represent the different aspects of the system, such as the classes, objects, and the different states of a transaction. This helped me to understand how these different diagrams can be used to represent a system and how they can be used to communicate the design to others.</p>

									<p>On the other hand, one of the negatives of completing this assignment was that it required a lot of time and effort to complete. Since the assignment was quite detailed and required a lot of research to understand the requirements of the system, it took me a lot of time to complete the assignment. Indeed, I failed to submit the assignment on time and so I had to send it as a resubmission.</p>

									<p>However, the time and effort that I put into completing this assignment helped me to develop, implement, and critically evaluate information system solutions. I was able to use my knowledge and skills to design a system that met the requirements of the assignment and that could facilitate business decisions.</p>

									<p>In terms of the impact that completing this assignment had on my personal and professional development, it has helped me to improve my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. Additionally, working on this project has reinforced my knowledge of software design and development and has given me practical experience in applying these concepts to a real-world scenario. Overall, I believe that this project has been a valuable learning experience and has helped me to develop my skills and knowledge in the field of software engineering.</p>

									<p>In conclusion, the assignment was a challenging but valuable learning experience for me. It helped me to improve my skills in using UML to design object-oriented information systems, develop, implement, and critically evaluate information system solutions, and appreciate the concepts and principles of information systems. Overall, the work I produced for this assignment was related to the module learning outcomes and helped me to develop my understanding and skills in information systems.</p>
