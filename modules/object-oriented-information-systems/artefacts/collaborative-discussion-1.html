									<p>In 2013, the launch of the Healthcare.gov website was marred by significant design failures that hindered the ability of customers to enrol in healthcare plans under the Affordable Care Act (Howles, 2014).  The reasons for the failure can be attributed to several factors.</p>

									<p>Firstly, the failure can be attributed to a lack of proper project management. The development of the website was outsourced to multiple contractors, resulting in a lack of coordination and communication between them (Howles, 2014). This lack of oversight led to missed deadlines and a failure to adequately test the website before launch (Howles, 2014).</p>

									<p>Secondly, the failure can also be attributed to a lack of user-centred design principles (Anthopoulos et al, 2016). The website was not adequately tested with actual users before launch, resulting in a confusing and difficult-to-use interface (Anthopoulos et al, 2016).</p>

									<p>Lastly, the failure can be attributed to a lack of testing and quality assurance (Gogan et al, 2016). The website was not thoroughly tested before launch, leading to significant technical issues that prevented customers from enrolling in healthcare plans (Gogan et al, 2016).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, the failure of the Healthcare.gov website can be attributed to a lack of proper project management, user-centred design principles, and testing and quality assurance. The failure had significant impacts, including long wait times, frustrated customers, and a delay in enrolments, which had both economic and reputational costs. This serves as a reminder of the importance of proper project management, user-centred design, and thorough testing and quality assurance in the development of information systems.</p>
