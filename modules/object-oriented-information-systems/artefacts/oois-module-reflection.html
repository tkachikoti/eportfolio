										<h1>Object-Oriented Information Systems - Module Reflection</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>The following paragraphs are a reflection on the learning and development that came about because of completing the Object-oriented Information Systems module. I will outline the aspects of the module that resonated with me the most and reflect on the impact they had on my personal and professional development.</p>

									<p>One of the key takeaways from exploring the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and its key phases was the importance of thorough planning and design in the early stages of the development process. I was able to understand the importance of gathering requirements, analysing the system, and designing a solution before moving on to the implementation phase (Shylesh, 2017). This helped me understand the importance of taking a systematic approach to the development process and how it can lead to a more efficient and effective outcome.</p>

									<p>Learning how to develop an object-oriented design for an information system was challenging. But it helped me understand the importance of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in object-oriented programming (Aniche et al, 2019). I was able to apply these concepts to the System Implementation project to design a robust and maintainable system. Such skills will prove beneficial for my professional development as a software engineer.</p>
									
									<p>Using UML to develop an object-oriented system design was a new concept for me. I found it challenging at first to understand the different types of diagrams and how they relate to each other. But, through practice and guidance, I was able to improve my understanding of UML diagrams and how they can be used to model the interactions between objects in a system.</p>

									<p>Developing a simple web server using the Python-based framework, Flask, was a great experience. I was able to understand how to create a simple web server and how to handle HTTP requests and responses. Analysing the common issues that can arise when deploying a system was another important aspect of development with Flask. This helped me understand the importance of testing and troubleshooting a system before deploying it to a production environment. I was able to identify and understand common issues such as compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues and how to mitigate them (Mufid et al, 2019).</p>
									
									<p>Understanding the implications of emerging technologies on privacy in information systems was an important aspect of the module. I was able to understand the importance of being aware of the latest technologies and their potential impact on privacy and security. This knowledge will be crucial for my professional development as a Software Engineer working in the Automotive Industry. As it will help me to be mindful about ensuring that the systems, I develop are secure and compliant with regulations.</p>

									<p>In terms of my own behaviour, I realised that I tend to jump into the coding and development part of the task without properly understanding the requirements and constraints of the project. This could be problematic, as it could lead to developing a solution that does not meet the needs of the stakeholders. I learned that it is important to take a step back and thoroughly understand the requirements before starting the development process. This will help me to avoid potential issues and mistakes in the future and will lead to a more efficient and effective outcome.</p>

									<p>Additionally, I recognized that I need to improve my time management skills, as I often found myself rushing through tasks or procrastinating, which led to last-minute stress and potentially suboptimal results. Being that I was undertaking several job interviews during the time I was completing this module, I found it difficult to juggle my commitments. This resulted in me missing deadlines, which ultimately resulted in me failing my first attempt at the module. Plus, my initial attempt at my resubmission was derailed due to relocating for a new job followed by a bout of illness. Going forward, I will try to better plan and organize my time to ensure that I can complete tasks in a timely and efficient manner regardless of my other commitments. I have found that using calendar reminders and Pomodoro timers to be effective solutions.</p>

									<p>Furthermore, I noticed that I tend to rely heavily on guidance and feedback from my mentors and peers. I realized that this is not a bad thing, but to take my learning and professional development to the next level, I need to be more proactive in seeking out resources and information, and in experimenting and trying new things on my own.</p>

									<p>In terms of personal development, I realized that the process of completing these tasks has helped me to develop my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. I have been able to apply the knowledge and skills that I have acquired to solve complex problems and make sound decisions. Furthermore, it has also helped me to develop my self-motivation and discipline, as I was able to push through difficult tasks and challenges and come out with a better understanding and knowledge.</p>

									<p>Overall, the completion of these tasks has been a valuable learning experience for me. I have gained a deeper understanding of the SDLC, object-oriented design principles, UML diagrams, database design, and SQL, and I have improved my problem-solving skills and ability to troubleshoot common issues that arise during deployment. Furthermore, I have gained a better understanding of the importance of emerging technologies and their impact on privacy in information systems. I have also identified areas where I need to improve, such as time management and seeking out resources and information independently, which will be important for my continued professional and personal development.</p>
