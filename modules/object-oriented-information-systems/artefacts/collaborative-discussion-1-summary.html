									<p>The failure of the Healthcare.gov website launch exemplifies the importance of proper project management, user-centred design, and thorough testing and quality assurance in the development of information systems (Howles, 2014). Incorporating agile project management methodologies, involving user representatives, and using automated testing and continuous integration and delivery can further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the system development process (Anthopoulos et al, 2016).</p>

									<p>One solution is to consider the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) when developing the system. The SDLC is a process that outlines the stages of development, from planning and analysis to implementation and maintenance (McMurtrey, 2013). By following the SDLC, organisations can ensure that the system is properly planned, designed, tested, and implemented, which can reduce the risk of failure (McMurtrey, 2013). Additionally, incorporating a change management process and having a dedicated team for maintenance and support can ensure that the system remains reliable and efficient (McMurtrey, 2013).</p>

									<p>It is also important to keep in mind the importance of data privacy and security. With the sensitive personal information that healthcare systems handle, it is crucial to ensure that the system is secure, and that data is protected from unauthorised access (Abouelmehdi, 2017). This can be achieved by implementing security controls such as encryption and access controls (Abouelmehdi, 2017). Regularly reviewing and updating the system, and involving stakeholders in the process, can help ensure that the system remains compliant with regulations (Abouelmehdi, 2017).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, implementing solutions and mitigations such as agile project management methodologies, involving user representatives, using automated testing and continuous integration and delivery, following the SDLC, incorporating change management process, having a dedicated team for maintenance and support, and ensuring data privacy and security can prevent similar incidents and minimize the impact on service users and the organisation.</p>
