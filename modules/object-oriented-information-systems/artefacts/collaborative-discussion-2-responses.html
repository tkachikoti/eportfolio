									<p><strong>Response:</strong> While NoSQL databases, such as key-value databases, offer high scalability, they often lack the ad-hoc querying and analytics features that are commonly found in relational databases (Seeger et al, 2009). This can make it difficult to create custom views of the data, which can be a major limitation for businesses and organizations that require more advanced data analysis capabilities (Seeger et al, 2009).</p>

									<p>To prevent these incidents, organizations can take several measures to ensure that they have the right kind of database for their specific needs (Menon et al, 2014). For example, they can use SQL databases for smaller datasets, where custom views and specific ad hoc querying and analytics are required (Menon et al, 2014). On the other hand, for large datasets, NoSQL databases are the obvious choice because of their high horizontal scalability (Seeger et al, 2009).</p>

									<p>Furthermore, Organizations can also consider using a data lake or data warehouse solution that allows them to store and analyse large and diverse data sets while providing SQL-like access to the data (Menon et al, 2014). This approach can provide the best of both worlds by providing the scalability of NoSQL databases and the ability to perform ad-hoc querying and analytics of SQL databases (Menon et al, 2014).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, the scalability issues of relational databases led to the development of NoSQL databases, which offer high scalability but lack ad-hoc querying and analytics features (Seeger et al, 2009). To prevent these incidents, organizations can use a hybrid approach, use SQL databases for smaller datasets and NoSQL databases for larger datasets or use data lake or data warehouse solutions (Menon et al, 2014).</p>

									<p><strong>Response:</strong> Graph databases rely heavily on the relationships between data, so it is essential to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent to prevent errors and inconsistencies in the relationships (Batra & Tyagi, 2012). One measure that could be put in place to prevent such issues is to ensure proper data validation and cleaning before storing it in the database (Batra & Tyagi, 2012). Additionally, a data governance strategy should be implemented to ensure that data is managed, stored, and updated in a controlled and consistent manner (Batra & Tyagi, 2012).</p>

									<p>Another measure that could be implemented is to use a combination of different database technologies for different use cases (Pokorny, 2015). For example, using a graph-based database for data visualization and analysis, while using a traditional relational database for transactional operations that require high consistency and data integrity (Pokorny, 2015). This would allow organisations to take advantage of the strengths of both types of databases while minimizing their weaknesses (Pokorny, 2015).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, NoSQL databases, such as graph-based databases, offer a powerful solution for handling unstructured data and providing efficient data visualization (Batra & Tyagi, 2012). To prevent incidents, proper data validation and cleaning, a data governance strategy, a combination of different database technologies should be implemented (Batra & Tyagi, 2012).</p>
