									<p>A document-oriented database, also known as a document store, is a type of non-relational database that stores data in the form of semi-structured documents, such as JSON or XML (Guimaraes et al, 2015). These documents are self-describing, meaning that the data and its structure are contained within the document itself (Guimaraes et al, 2015). In contrast, a traditional relational database stores data in tables with fixed columns and rows, and the relationships between tables are defined by foreign keys (Guimaraes et al, 2015).</p>

									<p>One of the main advantages of a document-oriented database is its flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data (Casallas et all, 2021). Unlike relational databases, which require a predefined schema, document stores can store data in a more natural format, without the need for a rigid structure (Casallas et all, 2021). This makes them well-suited for applications that require the storage of complex and nested data, such as social media or e-commerce platforms (Casallas et all, 2021).</p>

									<p>Another advantage of document-oriented databases is their ability to scale horizontally (Casallas et all, 2021). Because data is stored in a distributed fashion across multiple servers, it is easier to add more storage capacity as needed, without the need to restructure the entire database (Casallas et all, 2021). This makes them well-suited for applications that require high availability and scalability (Casallas et all, 2021).</p>

									<p>On the other hand, one of the main disadvantages of document-oriented databases is their lack of support for complex queries and transactions (Casallas et all, 2018). Unlike relational databases, which are based on a structured query language (SQL), document stores typically do not support advanced query functionality, such as joins or subqueries (Casallas et all, 2018). This can make it more difficult to perform complex data analysis or reporting (Casallas et all, 2018). Additionally, document stores usually lack the ability to perform ACID transactions that are essential to maintain data consistency (Casallas et all, 2018).</p>

									<p>Another disadvantage of document-oriented databases is the lack of consistency (Casallas et all, 2018). Since data is not stored in a predefined schema, there is a risk of inconsistencies that can arise when different documents contain different fields or different types of data (Casallas et all, 2018). This can make it more difficult to maintain data integrity and to ensure that data is consistent across different parts of the application (Casallas et all, 2018).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, document-oriented databases and traditional relational databases have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Document-oriented databases are well-suited for applications that require the storage of complex and nested data, scalability, and flexibility, while traditional relational databases are better suited for applications that require advanced query functionality, consistency and support for ACID transactions (Casallas et all, 2021). The choice between the two will depend on the specific requirements of the application and the trade-offs that are willing to make.</p>
