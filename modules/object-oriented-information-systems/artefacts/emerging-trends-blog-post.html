									<h2>The inflection points of Artificial Intelligence research</h2>

									<p>One area of research and development in information systems that has seen significant growth in recent years is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, understanding natural language, and making decisions (Boden, 1996).</p>

									<p>Emerging technologies in AI include natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and machine learning (ML) (Cioffi et al, 2020). NLP allows machines to understand and respond to human speech, making it possible for them to interact with humans in a more natural way (Malik et al, 2018). Computer vision allows machines to understand and interpret visual information, such as images and videos (Malik et al, 2018). ML is a method of teaching machines to learn from data, enabling them to improve their performance over time (Malik et al, 2018).</p>

									<p>The implications of AI are far-reaching and can be both positive and negative. On the one hand, AI has the potential to improve efficiency and productivity in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation (Guerreiro et al, 2021). AI-powered systems can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, making it possible to identify patterns and make predictions that would be impossible for humans to do (Guerreiro et al, 2021). This can lead to better decision-making and improved outcomes for businesses and individuals alike (Guerreiro et al, 2021).</p>
									
									<p>An example of this can be seen in the UK biggest supermarket, Tesco. They use AI-powered cameras to monitor inventory levels in real-time, reducing the need for manual stock-taking and increasing efficiency in the supply chain (Cao, 2021). This has led to improved product availability on store shelves and a reduction in waste, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction and revenue for the company (Cao, 2021).</p>

									<p>On the other hand, the development of AI raises important ethical and legal questions. As machines become more capable, there is a risk that they will replace human workers, leading to job losses and economic inequality (Cioffi et al, 2020). Additionally, there is a risk that AI will be used to discriminate against certain groups of people, such as the elderly or those with disabilities (Cioffi et al, 2020).</p>
									
									<p>An example of AI discrimination occurred in 2018 when Amazon's facial recognition technology, Rekognition, was found to have a higher rate of incorrectly identifying darker-skinned individuals and people with gender non-conforming faces (Mane et al, 2019). The incident highlights the importance of addressing and preventing bias in AI systems to ensure fair and just treatment for all individuals (Mane et al, 2019).</p>

									<p>In conclusion, AI is a rapidly growing area of research and development in information systems that has the potential to bring significant benefits to society (Cioffi et al, 2020). However, it is important to consider the potential negative implications of AI and take steps to mitigate them (Cioffi et al, 2020). This includes addressing the ethical and legal questions raised by AI and taking steps to ensure that the technology is used responsibly (Cioffi et al, 2020). As AI continues to advance, it is essential that we stay vigilant and take a thoughtful, proactive approach to its development and deployment (Cioffi et al, 2020).</p>
